# Pelagicatchview_Kochi
A R shiny app showcasing mock spatial points of pelagic fisheries in Arabain sea
PelagicatchView_Kochi is an interactive R Shiny application designed to demonstrate spatial and temporal visualization of pelagic longline fisheries data.
The app simulates the fishing activity of vessels operating from Kochi, India, including mock spatial locations, catch summaries, and trip-level statistics.
This app was conceptualized based on fieldwork conducted as part of the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS)–India marine program by me.
This project was developed to showcase interactive visualization techniques for fisheries monitoring and data management, using simulated data that mirrors realistic patterns while protecting the confidentiality of actual datasets.

🔗 Live App: https://sharangshaa.shinyapps.io/Pelagicatchview_Kochi/
🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this app is to:

Demonstrate spatial visualization of fishing operations and catch data of bill fishes and elasmobranchs

Showcase R Shiny’s potential for fisheries data communication and decision support

Encourage open, reproducible tools for marine research and monitoring
⚙️ Key Features

🗺️ Interactive Map: Displays mock fishing ground locations generated randomly in pelagic Arabian sea

🎣 Catch Composition: Visual summaries of catch of billfishes and sharks

⛵ Trip Statistics: active fishing days
🧮 Data Filters: Explore fishing trips by gear type (longline and gillnet), and year slider

💡 Dynamic UI: Built with R Shiny and leaflet for smooth interactivity

⚠️ Data Disclaimer

The data displayed in this application are entirely simulated and do not represent real fishing locations or catches.

Latitude and longitude values were randomly generated using publicly available coordinates in arabian sea.

Catch data were synthetically generated to mimic realistic patterns for demonstration and educational purposes.

No confidential or unpublished data are shared in this repository.

This project is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.

The underlying real data were collected during fieldwork at WCS–India, and are currently being analyzed for a manuscript on the socio-economic and ecological characteristics of pelagic shark fisheries in India.
